# [Node.js for Embedded Systems](http://embeddednodejs.com)

Welcome to Node.js for Embedded systems!

In this code repository, you will find additional links and resources to get started with JavaScript and embedded devices.

This site is not perfect. You can help to add links by issuing a pull requests on the JSON file in the `/links` folder.
Links will get rendered with the `render_links.js` script.

Once merged, I upload links [to the book website](http://embeddednodejs.com/chapters.html) that is hosted on Amazon S3.

Each chapter will get its own code repository with examples.


# Contribute!

All links related to embedded systems and Node.js are of interests. 

Also, links and questions that don't fit to a specific chapter are welcome.

Thanks for your contributions!
